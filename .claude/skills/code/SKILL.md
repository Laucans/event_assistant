description: Implement the task in docs/current/SPEC.md end to end — pre-flight gate against docs/current/HUMAN_ACTION_TRACKING.md, a checklist from the spec's Approach, the build, every Verification bullet run with real output, /code-review, then branch → PR → gh pr merge --rebase. Use when a spec is ready to build, when starting the implementation stage of the docs pipeline, or when the user says "/code", "implement the spec", "start coding the task", "build what the spec says", or "you are code".

# Role: Implementer

You take the single task described in `docs/current/SPEC.md` and land it:
pre-flight gate, plan, build, verify with real output, review, PR, merge.

You do **not** write specs (`/analyst`), do **not** re-plan the milestone
(`/planner`), and do **not** archive (`/archive-instructions`). If
`docs/current/SPEC.md` is missing, say so and point at `/analyst` — never
reconstruct the task yourself.

The SPEC is the contract. Your job is to execute it, not to improve it.

## 1. Read first

- `docs/current/SPEC.md` — the contract: `Problem` (including the stop
  line), `Goals / Non-goals`, `Approach`, `Files & interfaces touched`,
  `Edge cases`, `Out of scope`, `Verification`.
- `docs/current/HUMAN_ACTION.md` — the committed short list.
- `docs/current/HUMAN_ACTION_TRACKING.md` — **read-only.** It carries the
  human's live ticks, rationale and notes. Read it before claiming to be
  blocked, and **never write a tick into it** — the ticks are the human's
  (`CLAUDE.md`, Workflow).
- `docs/current/CURRENT_MILESTONE.md` — which numbered task this is and
  what the following tasks are entitled to take.
- Every file named in the SPEC's `Files & interfaces touched`, before
  editing any of them.

Skip `docs/PROJECT.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` unless the SPEC sends
you there — a spec is written to be self-contained for a fresh session.

## 2. Pre-flight gate

Report all four findings, then wait for a go-ahead. Nothing is edited
before this.

- **Blocking human actions.** Quote every `- [ ]` item under *Before
  Claude starts* in `HUMAN_ACTION_TRACKING.md`. If any is open, stop —
  those block by construction. Items under *While Claude works* and
  *Before calling it done* are **not** blockers for starting; name them so
  the human knows what's coming, then carry on.
- **Working tree.** Run `git status --short` and name every dirty file
  that predates this task. You need that list at commit time: the Supabase
  spec, for example, starts with `.claude/settings.json` modified by
  someone else's change in flight, and staging it would be wrong.
- **Stale assumptions.** The SPEC's `Problem` section records what was
  verified when it was written. Re-check the cheap ones — an installed
  version, a dependency's absence, a file that should or shouldn't exist.
  A spec written weeks ago may describe a repo that no longer exists.
- **Missing inputs.** Values the SPEC needs from the human and hasn't got
  — a project URL, a key, a deferred decision. Ask for all of them at
  once.

## 3. Plan before building

`Human_guidelines.md` §1: explore → plan → build → verify, in order.

- Turn the SPEC's numbered `Approach` into a working checklist, one item
  per step (`TodoWrite` is the natural fit), so nothing gets skipped.
- Restate the SPEC's **stop line** out loud in your own words. It is the
  sentence that decides what you don't build.
- Confirm the checklist with the user before the first edit.

Do not redesign the plan. If a step turns out to be wrong, impossible, or
already done, **stop and say so** — never silently substitute an approach
the human never reviewed. Where the SPEC names a documented fallback, that
fallback is the only alternative you take (Supabase spec, step 8: if
`allowImportingTsExtensions` upsets the Next build, add `tsx` — not a
third path you invented).

## 4. Build

Work the `Approach` steps in order; a later step normally assumes the
earlier one landed.

- **Scope is the `Files & interfaces touched` list.** Touching anything
  outside it requires saying so first and getting an answer.
- **`Non-goals` and `Out of scope` are literal.** They are the next task's
  work, not an oversight to helpfully fix. "There are no tables yet" is a
  fact about this task, not a bug to close.
- **Write the failing test first** when fixing a bug, where practical
  (`CLAUDE.md`, Workflow).
- **Track background processes.** Anything still alive after a tool call
  returns — dev server, watcher, tunnel — gets an entry in
  `.llocal/running_process/PROCESSES.md` in that file's documented format,
  with `kill:` naming every pid that must die; `npm run dev` leaves a
  `next dev` child holding port 3000.
- **Secrets never enter the transcript.** Where the SPEC has the human
  write a key into `.env.local` themselves, don't ask them to paste it,
  don't read the file (a `.claude/settings.json` hook blocks it), and
  don't echo it into command output.

## 5. Verify

Run **every** bullet in the SPEC's `Verification` section and show the
real output. "Looks done" is not verification; a pass/fail signal is
(`Human_guidelines.md` §1).

- A bullet you cannot run is reported as **not run**, with the reason.
  Never assumed passed.
- Where the SPEC asks for a deliberate failure ("prove it green, then
  prove it red"), the red proof is as mandatory as the green one — a check
  that has never failed hasn't been shown to work.
- Never narrow a check to make it pass. A `git grep` that is supposed to
  return nothing and doesn't is a finding, not a bad grep.
- Run the project's own gates even where the SPEC doesn't list them all:
  `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, `npm run typecheck`,
  `npm run build`, `npm test`. CI runs all of them, and a file that is
  merely Prettier-dirty turns `ci` red at a step nobody was thinking about.

## 6. Review

Run `/code-review` before calling the work done (`CLAUDE.md`, Workflow;
adversarial review, `Human_guidelines.md` §6). Point it at the branch's
full diff with the SPEC as the checklist: every requirement implemented,
edge cases covered, nothing outside scope changed. Its findings are
addressed before the PR merges, or explicitly declined with the reason
stated — quietly ignoring one is what this step exists to catch.

## 7. Land it

Branch → PR → merge, every task, no exceptions (`CLAUDE.md`, Repository
etiquette). The local hook and the `main` ruleset that refuse a direct
push are a backstop, not something to test.

1. `git fetch --prune`, update `main`, then branch `<type>/<slug>` with
   the type from `.claude/skills/commit/SKILL.md` (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`,
   `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `AIchore`).
2. **Stage by name. Never `git add -A`.** Section 2 told you which dirty
   files aren't yours; this is where that list gets spent. Check with
   `git diff --cached --name-only` before committing.
3. Commit per `/commit`'s conventions. Never commit secrets; every new env
   var is documented in the committed `.env.example`.
4. `gh pr create`, wait for `ci` with `gh pr checks`, then
   `gh pr merge --rebase` — the only method enabled; the branch
   auto-deletes.

## 8. Edge cases

- **No `docs/current/SPEC.md`.** Stop and say `/analyst` writes it. Do not
  build from `CURRENT_MILESTONE.md` directly.
- **Already implemented.** If the working tree or `git log` shows the
  SPEC's artifacts already landed, report what exists and which
  Verification bullets confirm it — don't redo the work.
- **A *Before Claude starts* item is still unticked.** You are blocked.
  Quote it and stop — the tracking file is where you check, not where you
  tick.
- **The two human-action files disagree** (an item ticked in one, open in
  the other — the live Supabase pair does exactly this). Ask which is
  current instead of taking the convenient reading.
- **The SPEC contradicts `CLAUDE.md`.** `CLAUDE.md` wins on repository
  etiquette and on the constraints that aren't visible in the code. Flag
  the contradiction; don't silently pick a side.
- **A Verification bullet fails.** Fix it if the fix lies inside the
  SPEC's scope. Otherwise stop and report — never move the goalposts.
- **`next-env.d.ts` shows as modified.** It flips between `next build` and
  `next typegen`. Run `git checkout -- next-env.d.ts` before staging;
  never hand-edit it.
- **Scope creep mid-task.** An adjacent improvement you spot is a note for
  the next `/analyst` run, not a commit on this branch.
- **Two strikes** (`Human_guidelines.md` §4). If the same correction lands
  twice in one session, stop and suggest `/clear` plus a fresh `/code` run
  carrying what you learned. Grinding on in polluted context costs more.

## 9. Hand off

End by telling the user:

- what landed — the merged PR and the files it changed;
- each Verification bullet with its result and the output proving it,
  including anything **not run** and why;
- anything left undone, and the named later task it belongs to;
- which *Before calling it done* items in
  `docs/current/HUMAN_ACTION_TRACKING.md` are theirs to tick — not yours;
- to run `/archive-instructions` next.

This skill never ticks the tracking file and never archives.
