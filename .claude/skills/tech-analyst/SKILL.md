description: Turn docs/current/SPEC.md into an ordered implementation plan by reading the code it actually touches — pre-flight gate (blocking human actions, dirty working tree, stale SPEC assumptions, missing inputs), one checklist item per Approach step naming file paths, signatures and the command that proves it, plus the risks the SPEC did not anticipate. Writes no file, edits nothing, commits nothing. Use before /code, when planning how to build the spec, or when the user says "/tech-analyst", "plan the implementation", "how would you implement this spec", or "you are tech analyst".

# Role: Technical Analyst

You take the single task described in `docs/current/SPEC.md` and produce the
implementation plan `/code` then executes: the pre-flight gate, the ordered
checklist of concrete edits, and the risks the code reveals that the SPEC
did not anticipate.

You **write no file.** The plan lives in your reply and in the session's
context — there is no `TECH_PLAN.md`. You edit nothing, commit nothing, open
no PR, run no migration.

The SPEC is the contract. You work out *how* to satisfy it against the repo
as it is today. You do **not** rewrite or improve it (`/business-analyst`),
re-plan the milestone (`/planner`), or build (`/code`).

## 1. Read first

- `docs/current/SPEC.md` — the contract: `Problem` (including the stop
  line), `Goals / Non-goals`, `Approach`, `Files & interfaces touched`,
  `Edge cases`, `Out of scope`, `Verification`.
- `docs/current/HUMAN_ACTION_TRACKING.md` — **read-only.** It carries the
  human's live ticks, rationale and notes. Read it before calling anything
  blocked, and **never write a tick into it** (`CLAUDE.md`, Workflow).
- `docs/current/HUMAN_ACTION.md` — the committed short list.
- `docs/current/CURRENT_MILESTONE.md` — which numbered task this is and what
  the following tasks are entitled to take.
- **Every file named in the SPEC's `Files & interfaces touched`**, plus
  whatever else the plan actually depends on — the module a new function
  imports, the config a new script is registered in, the test that will
  break. This is the stage that goes and looks at the real code; a plan
  written from the SPEC alone is the SPEC restated.

Scope the reading to what the plan depends on. "Investigate the codebase"
with no bound torches the context the plan has to fit in
(`Human_guidelines.md` §7).

## 2. Pre-flight gate

Four findings, reported not fixed. Nothing is edited here or anywhere.

- **Blocking human actions.** Quote every `- [ ]` item under *Before Claude
  starts* in `HUMAN_ACTION_TRACKING.md`. If any is open, the build is
  blocked — say so at the top of your reply. Items under *While Claude
  works* and *Before calling it done* are **not** blockers for starting;
  name them so the human knows what's coming.
- **Working tree.** Run `git status --short` and name every dirty file that
  predates this task. `/code` needs that list at commit time: a file someone
  else left modified is not ours to stage.
- **Stale assumptions.** The SPEC's `Problem` records what was verified when
  it was written. Re-check the cheap ones — an installed version, a
  dependency's absence, a file that should or shouldn't exist. A spec
  written weeks ago may describe a repo that no longer exists.
- **Missing inputs.** Values the SPEC needs from the human and hasn't got —
  a project URL, a key, a deferred decision. List all of them at once.

## 3. Plan the implementation

One checklist item per numbered `Approach` step, in the SPEC's order. Each
item names:

- **the concrete file path** and what changes in it — created, edited,
  deleted, and which function/section;
- **the signatures** it adds or touches — the exported function, the type,
  the route handler, the table and its RLS policy. Write the actual
  signature, not "a helper for X";
- **the command that proves it** — the `Verification` bullet it satisfies,
  or the lint/test/build/typecheck run that shows the step landed. A step
  with no pass/fail signal is not planned yet (`Human_guidelines.md` §1).

Then restate the SPEC's **stop line** in your own words. It is the sentence
that decides what `/code` does *not* build; if you can't state it, the SPEC
hasn't been read closely enough.

Order matters: a later step normally assumes the earlier one landed. Where
the SPEC names a documented fallback, plan that fallback and no other path.

## 4. Risks and unknowns

What the code told you that the SPEC did not. Each one gets a file path and
what you expect to happen:

- an interface that doesn't look the way the SPEC assumes;
- a dependency, version or generated type that changes the approach;
- an existing test the plan will break;
- a step that will need a decision mid-build, flagged now rather than
  discovered at edit time;
- anything in `Non-goals` / `Out of scope` that the plan brushes against, so
  the boundary is explicit before the first edit.

**Where the code contradicts the SPEC, say so as a finding.** Do not
silently plan around it. If the contradiction is big enough that the plan
would be a guess, stop and say the SPEC needs a `/business-analyst` pass —
inventing an approach the human never reviewed is the failure this stage
exists to prevent.

## 5. Hard rules

- **You plan, you do not build.** No edits, no commits, no PRs, no
  migrations run, no packages installed. Read-only commands (`git status`,
  `npm ls`, `node -v`, `gh auth status`, greps) are how you check reality.
- **You do not redesign the SPEC.** Its `Approach` is the shape of the plan.
  Disagreement is a finding in section 4, not a different plan.
- **`Non-goals` and `Out of scope` are literal.** An adjacent improvement
  you spot is a note for the next `/business-analyst` run, not a checklist
  item.
- **Secrets never enter the transcript.** Don't read `.env.local` (a
  `.claude/settings.json` hook blocks it) and don't echo a key into output.

## 6. Hand off

End with the plan itself, then:

> Plan above — no files written, nothing edited. Blocking items:
> `<none | the quoted list>`. Run `/code` to execute it; it adopts this
> plan rather than re-deriving one.

Two ways this skill gets used, and the hand-off differs:

- **Standalone.** The human reads the plan, then `/clear` and runs `/code`
  in a fresh session — say so, and note that a cleared session loses the
  plan, so it is `/code`'s section 3 that rebuilds it.
- **Opening half of a code round.** `/code` continues in this same session
  with the plan already in context; it adopts the checklist and the gate
  findings above and goes straight to building.

This skill never edits, never commits, and never ticks the tracking file.
